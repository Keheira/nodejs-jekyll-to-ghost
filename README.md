Node.js Jekyll to Ghost
======================

This plugin will help you to export your Markdown posts from [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to a format that can be easily imported into [Ghost?](http://ghost.org). <br> 
It doesn't handle static pages, and it doesn't do anything with images. You'll have to copy those over yourself and manually adjust any URL differences.

This was built by reverse-engineering the version of [Wordpress plugin](https://github.com/redwallhp/Jekyll-to-Ghost/) and  [Ghost schema](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/data/schema.js) to match the JSON file it outputs.
